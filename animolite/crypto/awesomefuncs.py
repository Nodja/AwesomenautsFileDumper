    RE notes:
    1. Get utf-16 version of relative file path. Needs to be lower case version of path.
      Example: "data\\settings\all.settings" is represented by b"\x64\x00\x61\x00\x74\x00\x61\x00..."
                (note the 2 bytes per character "d" = b"\x64\x00")

    2. Do a SHA-1 hash on the filepath.

    3. The first 4 bytes of this hash and the size in bytes of the file is then used on a algorithm that seems to be
       some sort of PRNG. There was more instructions reversed in the actual algorithm, but they didn't seem to affect
       output.
